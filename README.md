# Scalable Optical Learning Operator 

This repository contains code used for the manuscript title as Scalable Optical Learning Operator by U. Tegin et al. (2020).

Simulations folder contains a time-dependent beam propagation simulation for graded-index multimode fiber. The code is written in Python with the CuPy library to perform GPU parallelized simulations. 

Exp_LinReg folder contains the numerical decision layer used in the manuscript. Regression and categorization tasks for the studied datasets in the manuscript are performed with these codes written in Python with Tensorflow library and Keras API.
